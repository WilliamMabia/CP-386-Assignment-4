# CP-386-Assignment-4

## Description: ##
In this assignment I wrote a multi threaded program that implements the banker's algorithm and a program thsat uses best-fit algorithm of contigous memory allocation. <br>
**Bankers Algorithm:** Customers request and release resources from the bank. The banker will keep track of the resources. The
banker will grant a request if it satisfies the safety algorithm. If a request does not leave the system in a
safe state, the banker will deny it <br> 
<br>
**Best-Fit Algorithm:** This algorithm involves managing a contiguous region of memory of size MAX where addresses may range from 0 ... MAX ‚àí 1 <br>

## Use Examples ##
**Bankers Algorithm:** used majorly in the banking system to avoid deadlock. It helps you to identify whether a loan will be given or not. This algorithm is used to test for safely simulating the allocation for determining the maximum amount available for all resources.<br>
**Best-Fit Algorithm:** Using this Algorithm, the operating system allocates the job minimum possible space in the memory, making memory management very efficient. To save memory from getting wasted, it is the best method.
